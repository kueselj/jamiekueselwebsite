The purpose of the site is to aid weight-lifters, specifically those performing the Bench Press, to be able to determine their One Rep Max. This means the maximum ammount of weight they can do for a single rep. They are able to enter a previous lift the've done (weight lifted and reps performed) and the website will then calculate their One Rep Max. It is calculated using the Epley formula. It is simply (weight * (1 + reps/30)) Soon, I will compound more formulas to get a more diversified answer. I also included an Advanced Calculator in which a user can figure out how much weight they can lift for a number of reps other than one. I am also releasing a similar website for calculating Squat and Deadlift One Rep Maxes as well.
