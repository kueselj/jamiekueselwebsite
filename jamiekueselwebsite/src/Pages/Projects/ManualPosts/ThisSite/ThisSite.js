            Oh the joy that is this site. This site has, embarrassingly, taken a very long time to develop and I have gone through many iterations. I may have bit off more than I could chew when initially developing it. I had too many ideas and too many things I wanted to do before I even had solid experience with HTML and CSS. This resulted in many messy, gross looking prototypes. Unfortunately there is still a little bit of that here. However, Iâ€™ve learned to really dissect a site as much as possible. Keeping as many components separate helps with organization greatly. There is still much to do, but I have a very solid foundation for adding new projects to show off, and any new features I wish to explore. Luckily, I can now focus on doing some projects in some other spaces. I hope you enjoy the site! This site is built on ReactJS with SCSS style sheets.
